SHORT DESCRIPTION
	This is a PowerShell module that exposes the functionality of Visual Studio as well as several qualify of life operations through PowerShell functions.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	Visual Studio has a $dte variable that is accessible through the Package Manager Console (a PowerShell friendly console that lives in Visual Studio).
	Visual Studio functionality is able to be exposed through this $dte object, such as customizing options or setting NuGet sources.
	With the $dte object, we can also do things like restarting a visual studio solution or unloading and reloading projects (these would be considered quality of life functions).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
	There are a few functions:
		Restart-Solution:     This function closes the currently open solution and re-opens it.
		Get-SolutionName:     This function returns the name of the currently open solution.
		Get-Project:          This function returns the object that represents a Visual Studio project.
